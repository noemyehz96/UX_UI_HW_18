            <p>Hello, it's a pleasure to meet you! I am Noemy Hernandez, a UX/UI designer with an insatiable passion for learning and exploring new ideas. During college, my focus was in the sciences, and my curiosity thrived as I delved into the complexity of the human mind. I constantly yearned to expand my knowledge. In my leisure time, I immerse myself in all things art-related, always envisioning a career that seamlessly blends creativity with science. When I discovered UX/UI, I instantly knew it was the perfect path for me.
